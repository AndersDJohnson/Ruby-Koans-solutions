      <h1>EdgeCase Ruby Koans</h1>
<p>
The Ruby Koans walk you along the path to enlightenment in order to learn
Ruby. The goal is to learn the Ruby language, syntax, structure, and some
common functions and libraries. We also teach you culture. Testing is not
just something we pay lip service to, but something we live. It is
essential in your quest to learn and do great things in the language.
</p>
<h2>The Structure</h2>
<p>
The koans are broken out into areas by file, hashes are covered in
about_hashes.rb, modules are introduced in about_modules.rb, etc. They are
presented in order in the path_to_enlightenment.rb file.
</p>
<p>
Each koan builds up your knowledge of Ruby and builds upon itself. It will
stop at the first place you need to correct.
</p>
<p>
Some koans simply need to have the correct answer substituted for an
incorrect one. Some, however, require you to supply your own answer. If you
see the method <tt>__</tt> (a double underscore) listed, it is a hint to
you to supply your own code in order to make it work correctly.
</p>
<h2>Installing Ruby</h2>
<p>
If you do not have Ruby setup, please visit <a
href="http://ruby-lang.org/en/downloads">ruby-lang.org/en/downloads</a>/
for operating specific instructions. In order to run this you need ruby and
rake installed. To check the installations simply type:
</p>
<p>
*nix platforms from any terminal window:
</p>
<pre>
   [~] $ ruby --version
   [~] $ rake --version
</pre>
<p>
Windows from the command prompt (cmd.exe)
</p>
<pre>
   c:\ruby --version
   c:\rake --version
</pre>
<p>
Any response for Ruby with a version number greater than 1.8 is fine
(should be around 1.8.6 or more). Any version of rake will do.
</p>
<h2>The Path To Enlightenment</h2>
<p>
You can run the tests through rake or by calling the file itself (rake is
the recommended way to run them as we might build more functionality into
this task).
</p>
<p>
*nix platforms, from the koans directory
</p>
<pre>
    [ruby_koans] $ rake                           # runs the default target :walk_the_path
    [ruby_koans] $ ruby path_to_enlightenment.rb  # simply call the file directly
</pre>
<p>
Windows is the same thing
</p>
<pre>
    c:\ruby_koans\rake                             # runs the default target :walk_the_path
    c:\ruby_koans\ruby path_to_enlightenment.rb    # simply call the file directly
</pre>
<h3>Red, Green, Refactor</h3>
<p>
In test-driven development the mantra has always been, red, green,
refactor. Write a failing test and run it (red), make the test pass
(green), then refactor it (that is look at the code and see if you can make
it any better. In this case you will need to run the koan and see it fail
(red), make the test pass (green), then take a moment and reflect upon the
test to see what it is teaching you and improve the code to better
communicate its intent (refactor).
</p>
<p>
The very first time you run it you will see the following output:
</p>
<pre>
    [ ruby_koans ] $ rake
    (in /Users/person/dev/ruby_koans)
    cd koans

    Thinking AboutAsserts
      test_assert_truth has damaged your karma.

    You have not yet reached enlightenment ...
    &lt;false&gt; is not true.

    Please meditate on the following code:
    ./about_asserts.rb:10:in `test_assert_truth'
    path_to_enlightenment.rb:27

    mountains are merely mountains
</pre>
<p>
You have come to your first stage. If you notice it is telling you where to
look for the first solution:
</p>
<pre>
    Please meditate on the following code:
    ./about_asserts.rb:10:in `test_assert_truth'
    path_to_enlightenment.rb:27
</pre>
<p>
We then open up the about_asserts.rb file and look at the first test:
</p>
<pre>
    # We shall contemplate truth by testing reality, via asserts.
    def test_assert_truth
      assert false                # This should be true
    end
</pre>
<p>
We then change the <tt>false</tt> to <tt>true</tt> and run the test again.
After you are done, think about what you are learning. In this case, ignore
everything except the method name (<tt>test_assert_truth</tt>) and the
parts inside the method (everything before the <tt>end</tt>).
</p>
<p>
In this case the goal is for you to see that if you pass a value to the
<tt>assert</tt> method, it will either ensure it is <tt>true</tt> and
continue on, or fail if in fact the statement is <tt>false</tt>.
</p>
<h2>Inspiration</h2>
<p>
A special thanks to Mike Clark and Ara Howard for inspiring this project.
Mike Clark wrote an excellent blog post about learning Ruby through unit
testing. This sparked an idea that has taken a bit to solidify, that of
bringing new rubyists into the community through testing. Ara Howard then
gave us the idea for the Koans in his ruby quiz entry on Meta Koans (a must
for any rubyist wanting to improve their skills). Also, &quot;The Little
Lisper&quot; taught us all the value of the short questions/simple answers
style of learning.
