= Ruby Koans solutions

My solutions to Ruby Koans from Edgecase (http://rubykoans.com/).

"The Ruby Koans walk you along the path to enlightenment in order to learn Ruby.
The goal is to learn the Ruby language, syntax, structure, and some common
functions and libraries. We also teach you culture. Testing is not just something we
pay lip service to, but something we live.  It is essential in your quest to learn
and do great things in the language."
